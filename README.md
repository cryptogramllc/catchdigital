<!-- # Catch front end developer test

This is a short technical competency test to asses your current level of skill and understanding by asking you to build a part of a webpage from a provided design. Please read through this entire README before starting the test.

## Overview of test
We would like you create the provided design as a single webpage prototype using HTML, CSS and JavaScript where necessary. Please develop the page features as you interpret the design - we want to see your ability to work by eye.

The design is for a case study landing page on a Catch website. The page comprises 6 cards linking to the main case study page (not to be built). The filters should collapse on mobile with the ability for mobile users to show/hide them. Each card should include an image with a title and subtitle.

Please approach the build as you choose, using whichever framework or third party plugin you like if you think it's necessary to deliver any of the page features.

With your test submission, we're keen to see your current level of skill, so please ensure you demonstrate this with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript you write.

If you use anything to run the page like Docker, Webpack etc please ensure that all files needed to run the website are made available on test submission with the necessary commands needed to run them. See 'Deliverables' below for a complete list.

If you use a JS or CSS pre-processor please ensure that the build and source files are submitted along with any build script necessary to build from source. See 'Deliverables' below for a complete list.

## Hints
 - The [desktop](./designs/desktop.png) and [mobile](./designs/mobile.png) designs are available in [/designs](./designs) directory
 - All necessary exported assets are available in the [/assets](./assets) directory
 - The font used is 'Omnes' and is available with generated specimen HTML/CSS in [/fonts](./fonts)
 - The menu does not have to do anything, but should use a HTML element suitable for showing/hiding the menu in the future
 - The filters do not have to filter the content below, but should be 'clickable' on mobile and desktop
 - Any links to other content should go to `#0`

## Starting the test
We would not expect this test to take you more than **3 hours** having read through these instructions and familiarised yourself with the designs.

## Completing the test
If you do run out of time please try and tidy up what you have done so the prototype works and let us know when you send over the test.

## Deliverables
 - All the code you used to create the prototype as a public git repo or a `.zip` file
 - Instructions on how to run the protoype page in a README.md file along with:
   - A quick summary of your approach
   - A quick summary of any problems you ran into
   - A quick summary of what you might have done differently with more time -->

## Catch front end developer test

 1. Install Node dependencies.  
 ```
 npm install
 ```

 2. Start webpack to compile and run localhost.
 ```  
 npm run start
 ```


## summary
I decided to use React as a means of building out the UI. This would have made templating simpler and allowed for a rapid build out of the cards. All that was required was manipulating the props for each instance of the component.  

Problems mostly included issue with Webpack and trying to factor in @font-face found with in the css. Also had issue with importing SVG for the same reason.

If time allowed, I would have separated the components with their corresponding .scss files. It would have allowed for more readability.
